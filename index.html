<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>Orignally, we were inspired by the use of Glass. This seemed to be an app that lent itself directly to Glass and the features 
inherent in that technology. However, after Glass proved to be unsupported and overly complicated for this project, we decided to pivot. 
We reviewed our concept as a mobile device and realized that it was still entirely sound and feasible.</p>
<p>The app concept was initially targeted at art. We then considered utilizing GPS features to add geographical data. But truly, any 
and all this data could be combined to answer and inform on almost everything around you.</p>
